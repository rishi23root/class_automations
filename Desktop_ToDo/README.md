# Desktop ToDo
This is a very simple project it changes your current desktop background to Your todo list. 😎  
This is just about 30min project which takes 2h for me 😁😂 because I was stuck on changing background of the desktop many things tried but nothing works for me at last I was settled on a module `py-wallpaper`

## complete requirements
  - copy the command and run `pip install py-wallpaper pillow`

## update toDo json file according to you
YOU can update `ToDo.json` 
*example*
```info.json
    "ToDos":[
        "learn Metaclass",
        "c A* algo code",
        "triangle problem sol",
        "create repo for this project",
        "upload code",
        "code editor code",
        "pdf _compresser final commit"
    ]
```

# steps to using this program after cloning repo
  - cd Desktop_ToDo
  - update the `ToDo.json` file 
  - run the python program like this `python main.py`
